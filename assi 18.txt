Qno. 1 State the difference between statement,preparedStatement & callableStatement.
ans.
CallableStatement

It is used when the stored procedures are to be executed.
You can pass 3 types of parameter IN, OUT, INOUT.
Used to execute functions
Used to call the stored procedures.
No protocol is used for communication.

PreparedStatement
It is used when SQL query is to be executed multiple times.
You can pass any type of parameters at runtime.
Used to execute dynamic SQL queries.

Statement
The Statement is used for executing a static SQL statement.
we can not use statement for writing or reading binary data
it has slow interface is slow cuz it compile program for each execution

Qno. 2:- Why do we need the connection object?
Ans.
A Connection object represents a unique session with a data source. In a client/server database system, it may be equivalent to an actual network connection to the server.
 Depending on the functionality supported by the provider, some collections, methods, or properties of a Connection object may not be available.

Qno. 3:-Write the query for incrementing salary of all employees by 5 %.

Ans.
UPDATE tableName SET salary= salary + (salary * 5 / 100);

Qno. 4:-What is a Stored procedure, how do we call a stored procedure in java?
Ans.
A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.
package day18;

import java.sql.*;

public class Qno4 {

 public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
 {
     Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
    
     
     Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydb", "root", "");
    
     String sql_string = "insert into students values(?,?,?)";
    
     
     CallableStatement cs = con.prepareCall(sql_string);
    
     cs.setString(1, "val 1");
     cs.setString(2, "val 2");
     cs.setString(3, "val 3");
     cs.execute();
     System.out.print("added ");
 }
}


Qno. 5:- What are the benefits of using a trigger.

Ans
Define a trigger once and then reuse it for any application that uses the database.
Easier maintenance. If you want to change the logic of whole program, you need to change only the corresponding trigger program instead of each application program.
Improve performance in client/server environment all quires run in the server before the result returns.

Qno. 6:-
Ans.
JOIN
JOIN combines data from many tables based on a matched condition between them
It combines data into new columns.
Number of columns selected from each table may not be same.
Datatypes of corresponding columns selected from each table can be different.


UNION
SQL combines the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.
It combines data into new rows
Number of columns selected from each table should be same.
Datatypes of corresponding columns selected from each table should be same.


Qno. 7:-difference and examples of DDL,DML and DQL statements.
Ans.
DDL
Data Definition Language (DDL) have query CREATE, ALTER and DROP statements.
consists of the SQL commands that can be used to define the database schema. DDL allows to add / modify / delete the logical structures which contain the data or which allow users to 
access / maintain the data.
Create TableName ();

DML
Data Manipulation Language (DML) refers to the INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements
DML allows to add / modify / delete data itself.
UPDATE tableName SET salary= salary + (salary * 5 / 100);


DQL
Data Query Language (DQL) refers to the SELECT, SHOW and HELP statements (queries)
SELECT is the main DQL instruction. It retrieves data you need. SHOW retrieves infos about the metadata. HELP... is for people who need help.

Select * from tableName;

Qno. 8:-List the basic steps for JDBC.
Ans.
Register the Driver class.
Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
						
Create connection.
Connection Con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydb","root","");

Create statement.
String query = "insert into employee(empId,name,profile,salary) values(?,?,?,?)";
PreparedStatement ps = Con.prepareStatement(query);

Execute queries.
ps.executeUpdate();
