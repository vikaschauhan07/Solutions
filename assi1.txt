Qno 1:-Explain how and why Java came into existence.
Ans. Before java there are plenty of programming languages but they are failed to satisfy the criteria of a perfect language
so with improvement of the languages java is found which is platform indipendent and have various application like security and backward compatible.

Qno.2 :-  State the difference between JVM,JDK & JRE.
Ans.  JVM:- Java virtual machine is the interpreter for jaba loads, verifies and executes Java bytecode.
JDK :- The Java Development Kit is a development environment for building applications, applets, and components using the Java programming language. 
JRE:- It acts as a translator  and providing all the resources so that  it can runs on any operating system.

Qno. 3:-  Explain why is java portable.
Ans. Java is platform-independent because it uses a virtual machine. 
The Java programming language and all APIs are compiled into bytecodes. 
Bytecodes are effectively platform-independent. which make it to run on any platform without any modification.


Qno.4 :-State the difference in platform independent vs platform dependent with examples.

Ans. Platform dependent means that one can run over a specific operating system or needs some specific conditions or environment to work and execute the process. Whereas the platform
independent means it one can operate over, run and execute over any system without modifiy the specfications of the system.

Windows running on x86 hardware is the example of the platform dependent.
java is the platform independent. 

Qno. 5:- Explain the difference between interpretation vs compilation and how is the performance different.
Ans. Compilation is the process of converting the code in the byte code. Interpretation is the process of verifying the byte code and run it.
 And the diffrence in easy words is interpreter produces a result from a program while a compiler produces a program written in assembly language(0 1).



Qno 6:- What is backward compatibility and does java support this feature.
Ans. Java supports the backward compatibility. which means hardware or software system that can  use interfaces and data from previous versions of the system or with 
other systems. Which means it stores history or previous data or threads


Qno. 7:-State the difference between float and double.
Ans. Flaot is 32 bit numbers haveing 7 precision digits . Double is 64 bit having 754 double-precision floating-point number. double is more efficent then float whereas 
it can store bigger value then the float.


Qno. 8:-List all the operators that Java support.
Ans. 
Arithmetic Operators.
Assignment Operators.
Relational Operators.
Logical Operators.
Unary Operators.
Bitwise Operators.

    }
}


Qno. 10:-Write a program to find maximum between three numbers using conditional operator.

        int c = it.nextInt();
        if(a > b && a > c){
            System.out.println(a + " is the greatest");
        } else if (b > a && b > c){
            System.out.println(b + " is the greatest");
        } else{
            System.out.println(c + " is the greatest");
        }
    }
}
